# A properties file to map default keywords to test directories.  This is used
# to dynamically assign keywords when tests are found by the harness.  The
# keywords are then used by end-users to subset the tests being run based on
# Javatest's built-in keyword facility.  This is useful when running additional
# alacarte tests in addition to a defined profile.
#
# An entry key is a test directory relative to the testsutie root (i.e.,
# ${TS_HOME}/src) with unix file separator (forward slash). An entry value
# is a list of vehilce names separated by a space.  Althoug other reasonable
# delimiters may also work, a single space is recommended for consistency.
# Acceptable vehicle names are combinations of the following strings:
# ejb, servlet, jsp, appclient, and standalone.  Each item may only appear
# once in one entry vale.
#
# For examples, some invalid entries:
# /files/ts/src/com/sun/ts/tests/samples/jdbc = jdbc
# com\sun\ts\tests\samples\jdbc = jdbc
# com\\sun\\ts\\tests\\samples\\jdbc = jdbc
# samples/jdbc = jdbc
# /com/sun/ts/tests/samples/jdbc = jdbc
# com/sun/ts/tests/samples/jdbc = jdbc
# com/sun/ts/tests/samples/jdbc = jdbc
#
# Entry order is insignificant.  As a good practice, make the entry key
# (test directory) specific.  For example,
# com/sun/ts/tests/jdbc = jdbc
# conveys to the harness that all tests under com/sun/ts/tests/jdbc 
# should have the keyword, "jdbc".
#
# This file should not be modified by end users.
#
